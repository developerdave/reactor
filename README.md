Reactor
=======

Taking ideas by http://awtheme.com/docs/ and Matt Banks @mattbanks http://mattbanks.me/grunt-wordpress-development-deployments/
to combine foundation base WordPress template with SCSS and Grunt build 
scripts. 

Look at documentation on the Grunt build scripts here http://mattbanks.me/grunt-wordpress-development-deployments/ everything
else is left unchanged.

#### A powerful WordPress Framework generated using ZURB's Foundation
Reactor is a responsive parent theme for WordPress. That means that it can be used as is or made to look and function however you like using a child theme. Reactor comes packed with a bunch of great features such as shortcodes, customizer settings, and page templates. It also includes all the fantastic scripts and styles found in Foundation 4 by ZURB.
